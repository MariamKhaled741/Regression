House Price Prediction

A student project using **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict house prices based on different features like area and number of rooms.


  What We Did
- Cleaned the dataset
- Built a regression model using Python (`pandas`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`)
- Applied statistical analysis: ANOVA, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals
- Predicted prices and evaluated model performance

 Results
- Good accuracy in predictions  
- Gained hands-on experience with regression and statistical testing

 Files
- `house_price_regression.ipynb` – main notebook  
- `requirements.txt` – dependencies  
- Sample dataset and output plots
